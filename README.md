# Chorus Fruit

grabs different live video feed from preset list of youtube livestreams at a set time interval

used for a super sick setup with a monitor on my shelf that plays relaxing video all day. 
i get to watch the fishes. 

called chorus fruit because it "teleports" you. it's a minecraft reference.
